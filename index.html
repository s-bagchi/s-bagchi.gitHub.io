              Focusing on the environment of London, in its physical,
              infrastructural, sensorial and digital form, its perception can be
              incredibly subjective and unique, depending on the eyes of the
              beholder. In particular, examining London as a 'new' environment
              yields insights into how people adapt to new environments.
              <br />
              <br />
              In this research project, I look and document the experiences of 4
              international students studying at UCL, assigned letters for the
              purpose of anonymity. I highlight their experiences of making
              London their home as people who have moved here recently from
              different countries. When asked about what makes a place home,
              several themes arise: being familiar with and knowledgeable about
              a place, having material comforts, having a sense of community or
              people who are close to you. However, these are relatively
              abstract. When asked about their actual day-to-day experiences of
              becoming more familiar with London, what culture shocks they were
              dealing with, conversations mainly focused on food. Having come
              from places like India and Hong Kong, they missed home food, and a
              significant part of their time (without being conscious of it) was
              dedicated to finding that sense of home and comfort through food.
              Their interactions with London, be it through the places they
              visited the most, or through the apps on their phone, highlighted
              this as important.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              While my initial focus was on this aspect, utilising a more
              holistic perspective, I realised the connection between food,
              kinship and place for my participants. This relationship between
              the three has been recorded in literature, connected to more
              traditional anthropological themes around creating home and the
              role of kinship and sustenance (Carsten, 1997); however, I
              highlight a blurring of boundaries between home and city, and
              underline the role of the city and its physical and digital
              environment (Blunt & Sheringham, 2019). The way my participants
              chose where to live in London and the experience of finding this
              place relied on digital networks and technologies, which also
              informed their experiences with food, be it trying to live near an
              Asian grocery store or communal cooking practices. Here, I argue
              that digital technologies, be it more everyday technologies like
              Google Maps, communication over Facebook and WhatsApp groups, or
              delivery apps, can shape how one gets to know a city in the
              absence of prior knowledge. It helps you become more familiar with
              a city, find ways to make life more comfortable, and allows people
              to have more connections to have a sense of community— therefore,
              they create a sense of home.

              Participants A, B, and D are from India and live in a university
              hall, and Participant C is from Hong Kong and lives in North
              London with flatmates. I conducted in-person and online
              interviews, hanging out in communal spaces like common rooms and
              kitchens and outside, app studies and social mapping. As a point
              of departure, I use screenshots and social mapping to give a broad
              overview of their physical and digital environments. After the
              following fieldwork, using pictures and screenshots, I highlight a
              chronological journey for my participants, from finding a place to
              live, to realising how food is important, to navigating London,
              and finally documenting their progress for their family.

              Looking at my participants' phones revealed how their phones have
              changed in terms of the apps they have. For example, after having
              moved to London, their phones have apps either specific to London
              or only downloaded because they moved here (e.g. Citymapper, TfL,
              Deliveroo, etc.). These “London Apps” often exist next to apps
              specific to other cities they lived in (Bangalore, Hong Kong,
              etc.), underlining how apps in general create relationships to
              your space or city, as well as visually highlighting how their
              digital environments are affected by their physical environments.
              More often than not, to make space for new ones, the “Home City
              Apps” get deleted. These apps are also very much part of living in
              London, and necessary day-to-day.
              <br />
              The primary apps in common are related to travel, food delivery
              apps, and supermarkets and cafés as well as apps related to money
              and banking. In the pictures, the underlined apps are
              London-specific apps, and the circled ones are from their previous
              cities.

              I asked my participants to create a map of their 'worlds' in
              London, as a way of illustrating their relationships with the city
              and to show their familiarity with places close to them: for
              example, places they visit regularly like university or grocery
              stores, and other places they feel is important to them. Beyond
              home and work, the important places they consider important are
              usually to do with food: general grocery stores, Asian
              supermarkets, cafés, restaurants, kebab shops, etc. These are the
              aspects of the city salient to them on a map, as places they
              notice as part of their life, or places they travel to. This way
              of centering home and food is the primary focus of my research.

              The London rental market can be difficult, especially for someone
              who is navigating it solely through digital means. For most
              people, this was the first channel to finding out what living in
              London would be like, interacting with future landlords, flatmate
              or brokers. Participant C described the experience of writing a
              message to someone on Spareroom as similar to 'writing a cover
              letter'.
              <br />
              “I looked on Spareroom, Zoopla and Rightmove, and it was so
              stressful. They give you the impression that there are endless
              options and you can always find a place. But then you feel the
              competition when you start messaging and there is no response. I
              had to customise my response, explain why I wanted to live there.”
              <br />
              Looking for accommodation also involved finding networks of people
              in London to rely on and exchange notes. For example, Participant
              A and Participant B met each other on a university WhatsApp group
              for international students. They both chose to live in student
              accommodations because they would be able to meet more people and
              have a better sense of community. This started on the WhatsApp
              groups, where people used these places to compare notes and rant
              about the university or accommodation.
              <br />
              Participant C also found her future flatmate on a UCL postgrad
              Facebook group, and reached out to her to start flat-hunting
              together. Before she moved to London, she recalls speaking to a
              friend, asking for advice on where to live, which first informed
              her understanding of London. She chose to live in Finsbury Park,
              looking up the area on Google Maps. “I liked that there was this
              whole street of cafés and restaurants […] I saw the cute coffee
              shops when I came here, and imagined bringing my laptop to work in
              them”.

              “Home can be a lot of things […] for me, it is this dish my mom
              used to make in the Sunday mornings” — Participant A
              <br />
              Food was an especially important part of feeling a sense of home
              in a new city. Every participant talks about wanting to eat food
              which is consistent with what they had at home. However, a
              significant obstacle is the cost of living in London, especially
              to manage daily expenses like food. Here is a story from
              Participant D:
              <br />
              Participant D describes her initial experiences of grocery
              shopping as paying very close attention to prices, and it taking a
              toll on her wellbeing. She responds to these pressures around
              balancing expenses while also eating tasty and healthy food by
              creating weekly meal plans and preps, saying that “it was better
              for [her] mental health if [she] didn't have to think too much
              about what to eat”. However, having good food was an important
              part of creating a sense of home. Thus, we see how these people
              manage to have this experience with the resources they have.
              <br />
              Participant B is a keen cook, and misses home food in particular.
              After moving to London, as a way to have nice food without
              ordering too much, his cooking “has become much fancier here than
              at home”, saying that whenever he sees the price of delivery, he
              “realises he can just make it at home”. On a similar vein,
              Participant C says that Chinese food is too expensive in London,
              which is why she finds it cheaper and easier to cook meals like
              pasta or salads with Western ingredients. Still, comfort food is
              incredibly important for her, saying that she “always has
              dumplings in the fridge”.

              As a global city, London has pockets of East and South Asian
              grocery stores all over. For example, for Participants A, B, and
              C, the closest Indian grocery store to them was on Drummond
              Street, a place people were told about on the WhatsApp group for
              Indian students at UCL. The closeness of these stores to home is
              cited as a comfort factor, with Participant D saying that one of
              the best things about where she lived was having multiple Asian
              grocery stores nearby.
              <br />
              Creating a sense of home is not just about holding on to practices
              from the past, but also adapting and taking on new
              characteristics. For example, Participant A does not cook, but
              instead he likes to explore the options of different restaurants
              on delivery apps, buying meals so that he eats once a day (a habit
              from medical school). He finds this to be a major attraction in
              London, that you can access global cuisines, and he enjoys
              experimenting with food. Besides food delivery apps, he also likes
              going to the TianTian supermarket, and really likes makgeoli
              (Korean rice wine). He says, “I had never had it in India before,
              and ever since I found it, I keep some in the fridge”.
              <br />
              London is not only defined by what it has, but also what it
              doesn't. For example, Participant B talks about how the chili
              powder in London doesn't taste right or as good as it should, and
              “made for British people”, which is why he has brought supplies
              like spices from home. Similarly, Participant C talks about buying
              a rice cooker on a Chinese site called hktv, and paying to get it
              delivered in London, citing that “the taste of rice is different”.
              It is clearly seen that people make considerable effort to
              replicate and hold on to experiences of food which are culturally
              specific (like being able to taste the specific aspects of rice or
              chili powder). They can also make special preparations to manage
              time, for instance, with Participant D bringing a pressure cooker
              from home to make quick and tasty meals, and freezing chopped
              onion, garlic, and masala mixes (cumin, coriander, chili powder,
              and turmeric) to add to her food.

              Cooking food also has significant connections to maintaining
              relationships and spending time with friends nearby and family
              abroad. For example, Participant A spends a lot of time in his
              friends' kitchens at his university hall, with cooking not only
              becoming a communal bonding activity, but also “a way to have nice
              food”. On the other end, Participant B invites people over when he
              is cooking, He also highlights how he only walks to grocery stores
              when he is with friends. Additionally, an important part of
              cooking is documenting it through taking pictures, and sending it
              to family. This process illuminates several things: showing their
              pride over cooking something good, to entertain, inform or ask for
              tips, and even to demonstrate that they are taking care of
              themselves
